I created an interactive and insightful Pizza Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and understand the overall performance of pizza sales. The data was sourced directly from SQL Server, where we stored and managed our raw sales records. We connected Power BI to SQL Server using the "Get Data" option and selected the SQL Server database connector. This allowed us to load and transform the data using Power Query Editor, ensuring clean and structured data for visualization.

We used bar charts, line charts, pie charts, donut charts, and cards in Power BI to clearly present key performance indicators such as total revenue (₹817K), total pizzas sold (50K), total orders (21K), and average order value (₹38.31). Our analysis focused on identifying the busiest days, best/worst selling pizzas, and performance by pizza category and size. We also used slicers to filter data by date range and pizza category, giving users more control to explore the data.

Some key findings included that weekends (especially Friday and Saturday) are the busiest days, and Classic and Large pizzas are the top performers. The dashboards also highlight the Top 5 and Bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and order count.
